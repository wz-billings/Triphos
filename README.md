**Abstract:** Triphos is a number system motivated by the idea of using three axes (equally spaced \(120^{\circ}\) apart) on the two-dimensional coordinate plane rather than two. The Triphosian coordinate system has some similarities to the RGB additive coloring model of light. More importantly, Triphos has interesting algebraic and geometric properties. In this paper, we detail the construction of the Triphosian numbers, which has done previously, and we additionally provide a handful of new results about Triphos. Namely, regarding the algebraic structure of Triphos, we show that the field of Triphosian numbers has characteristic 0. We also provide novel results in Triphosian geometry: we construct the unit circle in Triphos, calculate the Triphosian equivalent of \(\pi\), derive a form of the Pythagorean theorem in Triphos, and provide details on computer implementations of Triphosian numbers.

In fall 2019, as part of my math capstone, I read the paper (PAPER NAME HERE) and attempted to answer some of the final conjectures put forward by the authors. In summer 2021, I got in touch with Andrew and decided that this project was potentially worth polishing. So now, in the present time (summer 2022), I am finally doing a small amount of work on this project again.
